      <p>The assignment given to me inherently requires that I optimise the website sufficiently and I will be documenting the processes that were involved with this. The tools which have been used
	  and/or will be used are programs such as Atom - the interpreter to write the code for the new system. NodeJS - the JavaScript variant that execute and display the website without the need of hosting it on a server among other supportive values that accompanies Node.
      PhpMyAdmin - this is the website which currently hosts the database and is accessed to view and manipulate database data so that it can be used for the new system. Currently I am still in the planning phase of the development and transition for the website.</p>

      <p>I have been tasked with revamping the current Product Owner system, this was a task delegated to me as part of the Agency team. The current peer review system is written in PHP and
	  hosted in such a way that makes it very difficult for modular additions to be added. Therefore my task is to translate the code to a more modern platform (NodeJs was chosen for this) and allow for future
	  additions to be made to the system easily by structuring the system in a modular fashion.</p>

      <p>I have decided to change the language with which I am developing this project with from Ren'Py to Visual Basic, this is due to
		 having more knowledge in Visual Basic and the belief that Visual Basic is fit for purpose for the type of prototype I am constructing.</p>

      <p>I have started development for a game which I am truly passionate about. The game involves attempting to replicate the experience of autism through virtual gaming environments.
         This is part of my dissertation where I will use the game to collect data to see if it is possible to replicate such an experience. The deadline I've set for myself to have this
         project achieved by is the end of March 2019.</p>

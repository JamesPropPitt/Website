      <p>I was one of two programmers which helped design the code behind <i>Sol Tenebrae</i>, a game by the team named Tedious Cats. This was done as part of a project throughout my time at Falmouth University during second year.
	  This project gave me the opportunity to further develop my teamwork and communication skills between myself and my cohorts. With the use of tools such as Slack and Trello we were able to co-ordinate ourselves to complete
	  tasks efficiently based on the role of the individual in the group.
	  I specifically worked on the artificial intelligence of the monsters, specifically the pathing and the behaviour in regards to the player. I based their behaviour on the ghosts from Pacman - some would follow the player, some would attempt to intercept the player and some would run away from the player.
	  I thought the behaviour of the ghosts from Pac-Man was a great example of a simple game exhibiting what could be potentially a very complex behaviour concept.</p>

      <p>Since beginning university I have been part of the committee of the university's autistic society. I was also one of the original founding members of the society back in 2016, along with 4 others. 
	  The idea for the society came from creating something which the people, who usually feel like the outcasts and alone, can feel a part of something. Essentially, we are a group of people who wouldn't normally socialise
	  with others, which on paper seems like a paradoxical concept. In practise, this has empowered members of the society to be able to go out and socialise and integrate with society better with the support of the autistic society.
	  This was a marvellous concept and I am very proud to be continuing to chime in whenever my advice is needed.</p>

      <p>This was my first attempt at co-operating with strangers on a project in a field where I have very little experience. Naturally the product could have been potentially much more than what it was. However, I don't see
	  this as a negative, this project was a huge learning experience, both in terms of programming proficiency and co-operation efficiency. I was introduced to tools such as Slack, Trello and the principles of Agile, scrums and sprint-based development.
